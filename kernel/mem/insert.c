 * Requirements:
 *  - If there is already a page mapped at va, it should be removed using
 *    page_decref().
 *  - If necessary, a page should be allocated and inserted into the page table
 *    on demand. This can be done by providing ptbl_alloc() to the page walker.
 *  - The reference count of the page should be incremented upon a successful
 *    insertion of the page.
 *  - The TLB must be invalidated if a page was previously present at va.
 *
 * Corner-case hint: make sure to consider what happens when the same page is
 * re-inserted at the same virtual address in the same page table. However, do
 * not try to distinguish this case in your code, as this frequently leads to
 * subtle bugs. There is another elegant way to handle everything in the same
 * code path.
 *
 * Hint: what should happen when the user inserts a 2M huge page at a
 * misaligned address?
 *
 * Hint: this function calls walk_page_range(), hpage_aligned()and page2pa().
